Image Processing and Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects and assignments focused on fundamental techniques in image processing and computer vision. The projects utilize popular Python libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy, and cover a wide range of topics, including:

1. Image Smoothing and Filtering (`Ass_01_Convolution`): Demonstrates convolution techniques for smoothing and filtering images.
2. Canny Edge Detection (`Ass_02_Canny Edge Detection`): Implements the Canny edge detection algorithm to identify edges in images.
3. Histogram Matching and Equalization (`Ass_03_Histogram Matching`, `L_03_Histogram Equalization`): Explores methods for adjusting image histograms to enhance visual quality.
4. Mini Projects and Feature Extraction (`Ass_04_Mini project`, `L_05_Feature Extraction`): Includes a mini-project and feature extraction techniques essential for image analysis.
5. Threshold Segmentation (`L_02_Threshold segmentation`): Implements basic threshold-based segmentation for separating objects from the background.
6. Frequency Domain Filtering (`L_04_Frequency Domain Filtering`): Demonstrates the application of frequency domain techniques to filter images.
7. Game Development (`GAME.py`): A small game project created using Python, showcasing basic game development skills.
8. Test and Requirements (`test.py`, `requirements.txt`): Contains test scripts and a requirements file to easily set up the environment for running these projects.
9. Results and Fourier Coefficients (`results.txt`, `fourier_coeffs.npy`): Stores output results and Fourier coefficients used in one of the projects.

These projects serve as a learning journey through various image processing tasks, providing practical hands-on experience for anyone interested in exploring the field of computer vision.
